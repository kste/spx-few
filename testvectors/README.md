# Testvectors

This folder contains test vectors using the NIST format for a subset of the new parameters. These have been generated
based on the reference implementation, with the modifications done in the FIPS 205 draft. The underlying implementation
used can be found at: https://github.com/sphincs/sphincsplus/tree/consistent-basew (commit 129b72c).
